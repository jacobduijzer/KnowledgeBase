How can we apply technology to drive business value? For years, we’ve been told that the performance of software delivery teams doesn’t matter―that it can’t provide a competitive advantage to our companies. Through four years of groundbreaking research to include data collected from the State of DevOps reports conducted with Puppet, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim set out to find a way to measure software delivery performance―and what drives it―using rigorous statistical methods. This book presents both the findings and the science behind that research, making the information accessible for readers to apply in their own organizations.

## Preface

> ...improvements in software delivery are possible for every team and in every company, as long as leadership provides consistent support - including time, actions, and resources - demonstrating a true commitment to improvement, as long as team members commit themselves to the work.

> Some key research questions were:
> * What does it mean to deliver software, and can it be measured?
> * Does software delivery impact organizations?
> * Does culture matter, and how do we measure it?
> * What technical practices appear to be important?
