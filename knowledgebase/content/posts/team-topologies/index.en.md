Team Topologies: is an excellent guide to structuring and keeping teams, processes and technologies aligned, for all kinds of organisations. It gives us a vocabulary and a model to direct our thinking in a way that allows for scaling up, and helps us to organise teams for effective software development.

## Preface

> Teams are always works in progress, but they are also your best shot at delivering value continuously and sustainably by aligning them with the business. 

> Long lived, autonomous, engaged members

## Chapter 1: The problem with Org Charts

> Businesses can no longer choose between optimizing for stability and optimizing for speed

> ... many organizations are still organizing people and teams in ways that are counterproductive to modern software development and operations

BVSSH: Previous ways of working were optimized for repetetive labor. It is nnecessary to optimize for early and often learning in a real environment with real customers or consumers. Work has moved from hand-making the same thing repeatedly (deterministic, known-unknowns) to **unique knowledge-based work** that is **emergent** and **full of unknown-unknowns**.

Beter Value Sooner Safer Happier by Jonathan Smart

> ... fail to create the necessary conditions to embrace innovations while still delivering at a fast pace. In order to succeed at that, organisations need stable teems and effective team patterns and interactions.

> ... to treating people and technology as a single human/computer carbon/silicon sociotechnical ecosystem

> ... we need to ensure that teams are intrinsically motivated

Read "Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us - Daniel Pink!"

> The problem with taking the org chart ... end up trying to architect people as if they were software ... keeping their communication within the accepted lines.

> Team Topologies focuses on how to set up dynamic team structures and interaction modes that can help teams adapt quickly to new conditions, and achieve fast and safe software delivery.

BVSSH: focus on outcomes. Agile, Lean, DevOps, design thinking, systems thinking, Theory of Constraints, and so on are all proverbial tools in a toolbox that organizations can employ to achieve desired outcomes. They are bodies of knowledge, years of wisdom acquired in the field of organized human endeavor, articulated as principles and practices. There is no cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach.

> Eventually, you will face the issue of rigid team structures with poor communication and.or inadequate processes, slowing down delivery.

Again, BVSSH: old structures, industrial revolution type of leadership. TODO, add reference

> Thinking of the org chart as a faithful representation of how work gets done and how teams interact with each other leads to ineffective decisions around allocation of work and responsibilities.

Leadership, ownership: extreme ownership? 
- Example 1: chain of command: the periscope operator. Submarines normally dive. They don't use their periscope a lot and thus do not train a lot. So, to prevent mistakes, they introduced a supervisor. What happened: the operator became sloppy, thinking the supervisor will prevent him from making mistakes. The supervisor in turn, thinks the submarine commander will be supervising him so he is also not fully taking responsibility.
- More examples: read Turn the ship around: many examples of how having a chain of command leads to dependent people who do not take ownership.
- Example 3: Extreme Ownership: when people know the goal and have responsibility, they take ownership of their part, take autonomous decissions. 

> Three different organizational stuctures in every organisation:
> * Formal structure (the org chart) - facilitates compliance
> * Informal structure - the "realm of influence" between individuals
> * Value creation structure - how work actually gets done based on inter-personal and inter-team reputation

> ... the key to succesful knowledge work orgaizations is in the interactions between the informal structure and the value creation structure (Plaeging)

> Five rules of thumb for designing organizations:
> 1. Design when there is a compelling reason
> 2. Develop options for deciding on a design
> 3. Choose the right time to design
> 4. Look for clues that things are out of alignment
> 5. Stay alert to the future

Important information when starting with implementing Team Topologies!

> Team Topologies privides four fundamental team types: stream-aligned, platform, enabeling and complicated subsystem and three core team interaction modes - collaboration, X-as-a-Service and facilitating

> Conway's law, team cognitive load, how to become a sensing organization

> Cognitive load, one person has a limit on how much information they can hold in their brains at any given moment

Code that fit's in your head: avg 7 things. [The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two).

> ... we hardly ever discuss cognitive load when assigning responsibilities or software parts to a given team

How can we measure cognitive load, is it measurable?

> Team Topologies results in an effective and humanistic approach to building and running software systems.

> Dip in motivation: three elements of intrinsic motivation: 
> - autonomy - quashed by constant juggling of requests and priorities from multiple teams
> - mastery - jack of all trades, master of none
> - purpose - too many domains of responsibility

Difficult prioritizations and context switching, even in one sprint, a dip in people's motivation.

> ... development of new services is often planned as if the team had full-time availability and zero cognitive load to start with. 

Ownership and leadership again! An autonomous team can not blame others when this happens.

> Obstacles to fast flow:
> - Pushing against Conway's law
> - Software too big for teams
> - Disengaged teams
> - Too many suprises
> - Flow is blocked
> - Painful re-org every few years
> - Team pulled in many directions
> - Confusing org desing options


> The Agile, Lean IT, and DevOps movements helped demonstrate the enormous value of smaller, more autonomous teams that were aligned to the flow of business, developing and releasing in small, iterative cycles, and course correcting based on feedback from users.

> The **goal of Team Topologies** is to give you **the approach and mental tools** to **enable your organization to adapt and dynamically find** the places and timing when **collaboration** is needed, as well as when it is best to **focus on execution and reduce communication** overhead.
