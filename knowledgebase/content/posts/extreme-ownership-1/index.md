What’s the secret to being a great leader? Whether you’re in a warzone or on the front lines of a corporate battle, Extreme Ownership argues that the best leaders take full responsibility for everything in their world: not only their actions, decisions, and failures, but also those of everyone on their team. By practicing Extreme Ownership, great leaders achieve victory by prioritizing the team above all else and focusing on constant improvement.

> Effective leaders lead successful teams that accomplish their mission and win. Ineffective leaders do not.

> have all the answers; no leader does. We’ve made huge mistakes. Often our mistakes provided the greatest lessons, humbled us, and enabled us to grow and become better. For leaders, the humility to admit and own mistakes and develop a plan to overcome them is essential to success.

> only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails.

> only two that matter: effective and ineffective.

> without a team—a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission—there can be no leadership.

> best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simply focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it.

> leadership is the most important factor on the battlefield, the single greatest reason behind the success of any team.

> By leadership, we do not mean the senior commanders at the top, but the crucial leaders at every level of the team -the senior enlisted leaders, the fire team leaders in charge of four people, the squad leaders in charge of eight, and the junior petty officers that step up, took charge and led.

A leadership program makes leadership scalable!

> They must believe in the cause for which they are fighting. They must believe in the plan they are asked to execute, and most important, they must believe in and trust the leader they are asked to follow.

Although we are not litteraly fighting, it applies to us too: do we believe in the plan? And in our leaders?

> Extreme Ownership. Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame.

## 1. Extreme Ownership

Chapter 1 starts with a battle in Ramadi, which ends up with friendly fire. Miscommunication, chaos, disorder. And accepting the failure as a personal failure.

> despite what happened, the full ownership I took of the situation actually increased the trust my commanding officer and master chief had in me.

> the burden of command and the deep meaning of responsibility: the leader is truly and ultimately responsible for everything.

It can be a burden, being a leader! It comes with responsibility and thus with a cost!

> PRINCIPLE

> On any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader. The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.

> Highlight:

> When subordinates aren’t doing what they should, leaders that exercise Extreme Ownership cannot blame the subordinates. They must first look in the mirror at themselves. The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute.

> an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must train and mentor that underperformer.

> Total responsibility for failure is a difficult thing to accept, and taking ownership when things go wrong requires extraordinary humility and courage.

> But if the underperformer continually fails to meet standards, then a leader who exercises Extreme Ownership must be loyal to the team and the mission above any individual. If underperformers cannot improve, the leader must make the tough call to terminate them and hire others who can get the job done. It is all on the leader.

> absolute necessity to learning, growing as a leader, and improving a team’s performance.

> leader, however, does not take credit for his or her team’s successes but bestows that honor upon his subordinate leaders and team members.

> junior leaders take charge of their smaller teams and their piece of the mission. Efficiency and effectiveness increase exponentially and a high-performance, winning team is the result.

> leader sets such an example and expects this from junior leaders within the team, the mind-set develops into the team’s culture at every level.

> a leader set ego aside, accept responsibility for failures, attack weaknesses, and consistently work to a build a better and more effective team.

> of looking at yourself, you blame others. But no one is infallible. With Extreme Ownership, you must remove individual ego and personal agenda. It’s all about the mission. How can you best get your team to most effectively execute the plan in order to accomplish the mission?”

> the direct responsibility of a leader included getting people to listen, support, and execute plans.

> “As the commander, everything that happened on the battlefield was my responsibility. Everything. If a supporting unit didn’t do what we needed it to do, then I hadn’t given clear instructions. If one of my machine gunners engaged targets outside his field of fire, then I had not ensured he understood where his field of fire was. If the enemy surprised us and hit us where we hadn’t expected, then I hadn’t thought through all the possibilities. No matter what, I could never blame other people when a mission went wrong.”

> you can’t make people do those things. You have to lead them.

> Extreme Ownership in their leaders, and, as a result, they emulate Extreme Ownership throughout the chain of command down to the most junior personnel. As a group they try to figure out how to fix their problems—instead of trying to figure out who or what to blame. For those on the outside looking in, like our training group—or the board in your case—the difference is obvious.”

> “And that is

> ended up with a unit that never felt they were to blame for anything. All they did was make excuses and ultimately never made the adjustments necessary to fix problems.

> The leader’s attitude sets the tone for the

> leadership is the single greatest factor in any team’s performance. Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader.

> no bad teams, only bad leaders was a difficult one to accept but nevertheless a crucial concept that leaders must fully understand and implement to enable them to most effectively lead a high-performance team. Leaders must accept total responsibility, own problems that inhibit performance, and develop solutions to those problems. A team could only deliver exceptional performance if a leader ensured the team worked together toward a focused goal and enforced high standards of performance, working to continuously improve. With a culture of Extreme Ownership within the team, every member of the team could contribute to this effort and ensure the highest levels of performance.

> entire team. The leader drives performance—or doesn’t.

> applies not just to the most senior leader of an overall team, but to the junior leaders of teams within the team.

> leader must pull the different elements within the team together to support one another, with all focused exclusively on how to best accomplish the mission.

> When leaders who epitomize Extreme Ownership drive their teams to achieve a higher standard of performance, they must recognize that when it comes to standards, as a leader, it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate. When setting expectations, no matter what has been said or written, if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable—if there are no consequences—that poor performance becomes the new standard. Therefore, leaders must enforce standards. Consequences for failing need not be immediately severe, but leaders must ensure that tasks are repeated until the higher

> every team must have junior leaders ready to step up and temporarily take on the roles and responsibilities of their immediate bosses to carry on the team’s mission and get the job done if and when the need arises.

> no bad teams, only bad leaders facilitates Extreme Ownership and enables leaders to build high-performance teams that dominate on any battlefield, literal or figurative.

> whether or not your team succeeds or fails is all on you.

> An individual with a Tortured Genius mind-set can have catastrophic impact on a team’s performance.

> is critical that those senior leaders impart a general understanding of that strategic knowledge—the why—to their troops.

> frontline leaders and troops understand why, they can move forward, fully believing in what they are doing.

> they must ask the question: why? Why are we being asked to do this? Those leaders must take a step back, deconstruct the situation, analyze the strategic picture, and then come to a conclusion. If they cannot determine a satisfactory answer themselves, they must ask questions up the chain of command until they understand why.

> leader must explain not just what to do, but why.

> from your leadership, it is up to you to ask questions until you understand how and why those decisions are being made.

> Not knowing the why prohibits you from believing in the mission.

> When you are in a leadership position, that is a recipe for failure, and it is unacceptable. As a leader, you must believe.”

## Chapter 15: 4. Check the Ego

> preservation. Often, the most difficult ego to deal with is your own.

> Everyone has an ego. Ego drives the most successful people in

> . Many of the disruptive issues that arise within any team can be attributed directly to a problem with ego.

> Ownership requires checking your ego and operating with a high degree of humility. Admitting mistakes, taking ownership, and developing a plan to overcome challenges are integral to any successful team. Ego can prevent a leader from conducting an honest, realistic assessment of his or her own performance and the performance of the team.

## Chapter 18: 5. Cover and Move

> All elements within the greater team are crucial and must work together to accomplish the mission, mutually supporting one another for that singular purpose. Departments and groups within the team must break down silos, depend on each other and understand who depends on them.

> leaders to continually keep perspective on the strategic mission and remind the team that they are part of the greater team and the strategic mission

> , we are forced to use their services.”

> “What you just called the worst part should be the best part,” Jocko responded. “You are both owned by the same corporation, so you both have the same mission. And that is what this is about—

> about—the overall mission, the overall team. Not just your team, but the whole team; the entire corporation—all departments within your company, all subsidiary companies under the corporation, outside contractors, the whole enterprise. You must work together and support each other as one team.”

## Chapter 20: 6. Simple

> Everyone that is part of the mission must know and understand his or her role in the mission and what to do in the event of likely contingencies.

> Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success. When plans and orders are too complicated, people may not understand them. And when things go wrong, and they inevitably do go wrong, complexity compounds issues that can spiral out of control into total disaster.

> If your team doesn’t get it, you have not kept things simple and you have failed.

> Plans and orders must be communicated in a manner that is simple, clear, and concise.

## Chapter 22: 7. Prioritize and Execute

> Even the most competent of leaders can be overwhelmed if they try to tackle multiple problems or a number of tasks simultaneously. The team will likely fail at each of those tasks. Instead, leaders must determine

> maintain the ability to quickly reprioritize efforts and rapidly adapt to

> A particularly effective means to help Prioritize and Execute under pressure is to stay at least a step or two ahead of real-time problems. Through careful contingency planning, a leader can anticipate likely challenges that could arise during execution and map out an effective response to those challenges before they happen.

> To implement Prioritize and Execute in any business, team, or organization, a leader must:

> • evaluate the highest priority problem.

> • lay out in simple, clear, and concise terms the highest priority effort for your team.

> • develop and determine a solution, seek input from key leaders and from the team where possible.

> • direct the execution of that solution, focusing all efforts and resources toward this priority task.

> • move on to the next highest priority problem. Repeat.

> • when priorities shift within the team, pass situational awareness both up and down the chain.

> • don’t let the focus on one priority cause target fixation. Maintain the ability to see other problems developing and rapidly shift as needed.

> . If the team has been briefed and understands what actions to take through such likely contingencies, the team can then rapidly execute when those problems arise, even without specific direction from leaders.

> priorities can rapidly shift and change. When this happens, communication of that shift to the rest of the team, both up and down the chain of command, is critical.

## Chapter 24: 8. Decentralized Command

> The proper understanding and utilization of Decentralized Command takes time and effort to perfect. For any leader, placing full faith and trust in junior leaders with less experience and allowing them to manage their teams is a difficult thing to embrace. It requires tremendous trust and confidence in those frontline leaders, who must very clearly understand the strategic mission and ensure that their immediate tactical decisions ultimately contribute to accomplishing

> Pushing the decision making down to the subordinate, frontline leaders within the task unit was critical to our success.

> This Decentralized Command structure allowed me, as the commander, to maintain focus on the bigger picture: coordinate friendly assets and monitor enemy activity. Were I to get embroiled in the details of a tactical problem, there would be no one else to fill my role and manage the strategic mission.

> rely on their subordinate leaders to take charge of their smaller teams within the team and allow them to execute based on a good understanding of the broader mission (known as Commander’s Intent), and standard operating procedures. That was effective Decentralized Command.

> empowered to make decisions on key tasks necessary to accomplish that mission in the most effective and efficient manner possible.

> empower frontline leaders through Decentralized Command and ensure they are running their teams to support the overall mission, without micromanagement from the top.

> junior leaders must fully understand what is within their decision-making authority—the “left and right limits” of their responsibility.

> frontline leaders do not understand why, they must ask their boss to clarify the why. This ties in very closely with Believe

> Without this trust, junior leaders cannot confidently execute,

> information—what we call in the military “situational awareness”—to their subordinate leaders. Likewise, junior leaders must push situational awareness up the chain to their senior leaders to keep them informed, particularly of crucial information that affects strategic decision making.

> leadership. And

> You could end up with that if you, as a leader, failed to give clear guidance and set distinct boundaries,” I explained.

> Proper Decentralized Command requires simple, clear, concise orders that can be understood easily by everyone in the chain of command.

> With clear guidance and established boundaries for decision making that your subordinate leaders understand, they can then act independently toward your unified goal.”

> As a leader, it takes strength to let go. It takes faith and trust in subordinate, frontline leaders and their abilities. Most of all, it requires trust up and down the chain of command: trust that subordinates will do the right thing; trust that superiors will support

> they have got to understand why they are doing it. When the subordinate leaders and the frontline troops fully understand the purpose of the mission, how it ties into strategic goals, and what impact it has, they can then lead, even in the absence of explicit orders.

> Team participation—even from the most junior personnel—is critical in developing bold, innovative solutions to problem sets.

> Often business teams claim there isn’t time for such analysis. But one must make time.

> Leaders must carefully prioritize the information to be presented in as simple, clear, and concise a format as possible so that participants do not experience information overload. The planning process and briefing must be a forum that encourages discussion, questions, and clarification from even the most junior personnel. If frontline troops are unclear about the plan and yet are too intimidated to ask questions, the team’s ability to effectively execute the plan radically decreases. Thus, leaders must ask questions of their troops, encourage interaction, and ensure their teams understand the plan.

> The best teams employ constant analysis of their tactics and measure their effectiveness so that they can adapt their methods and implement lessons learned for future missions.

> Focus efforts on the best course of action.

> • Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action.

> • Plan for likely contingencies through each phase of the operation.

> • Mitigate risks that can be controlled as much as possible.

> • Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders.

> —Stand back and be the tactical genius.

> • Continually check and question the plan against emerging information to ensure it still fits the situation.

> How do you want to be perceived?” I asked Darla. “Do you want to be seen as someone who can be held hostage by the demands—the threats—they are making? Do you want to be seen as indecisive?”

> As a leader, you want to be seen—you need to be seen—as decisive, and willing to make tough choices. The outcome may be uncertain, but you have enough understanding and information to make a decision,”

## Chapter 36: Afterword

> This means leaders must be heavily engaged in training and mentoring their junior leaders to prepare them to step up and assume greater responsibilities.

> When mentored and coached properly, the junior leader can eventually replace the senior leader, allowing the senior leader to move on to the next level of leadership.

> Extreme Ownership within their teams and organizations, the rest falls into place. Soon, a leader no longer needs to be involved in the minor details of decisions but can look up and out to focus on the strategic mission as the team handles the tactical battles.

> Leadership is simple, but not easy.

> Leadership decisions are inherently challenging and take practice. Not every decision will be a good one: all leaders make mistakes.
