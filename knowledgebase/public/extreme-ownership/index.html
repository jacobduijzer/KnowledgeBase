<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;it is all about the Team. The sum is far greater than the parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;there can be no leadership where there is no team.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;learned extremely valuable lessons through succes and failure. We made mistakes and learned from them, discovering what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something we can also say about more experienced leaders or engineers! Although not the same experience, hopefully they have learned and can tell some stories about it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;leadership requires belief in the mission and unyielding perseverance to achieve victory, particularly when doubters question whether victory is even possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="leadership-the-single-most-important-factor">Leadership: the single most important factor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;for any person who aspires to better themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>without a team -a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission- there can be no leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;only two [types of leaders] that matters: effective and ineffective. Effective leaders lead succesfull teams that accomplish their mission and win. Ineffective leaders do not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are by no means infallible leaders; no one is, no moatter how experienced. Nor do we have all the answers; no leader does. We&rsquo;ve made huge mistakes. Othen our mistakes provided the greatest lessons, humbled us, and enabled us to grow and become better.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For leaders, the humility to admit and own mistakes and develop a plan to overcome them is essential to success. The best leaders are not driven by eo or personal agendas. they are simply focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;leadership is the most important factor on the battlefield, the single greatest reason behind the success of any team.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By leadership, we do not mean the senior commanders at the top, but the crucial leaders at every level of the team -the senior enlisted leaders, the fire team leaders in charge of four people, the squad leaders in charge of eight, and the junior petty officers that step up, took charge and led.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;develop leadership training curriculum to build a strong foundation for all &hellip; leaders</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A leadership program makes leadership scalable!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They must believe in the cause for which they are fighting. They must believe in the plan they are asked to execute, and most important, they must believe in and trust the leader they are asked to follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although we are not litteraly fighting, it applies to us too: do we believe in the plan? And in our leaders?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extreme Ownership. Leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chapter-1-extreme-ownership">Chapter 1: Extreme Ownership</h2>
<p>Chapter 1 starts with a battle in Ramadi, which ends up with friendly fire. Miscommunication, chaos, disorder. And accepting the failure as a personal failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;despite what happened, the full ownership I took of the sitauation actually increased the trust my commanding officer and master chief had in me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the burden of command and the deep meaning of responsibility: the leader is truly and ultimately responsible for everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be a burden, being a leader! It comes with responsibility and thus with a cost!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader. The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If an individual on the team is <strong>not performing</strong> at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader <strong>must</strong> train and mentor that underperformer. But if the underperformer continually fails to meet standards, then a leader who exercises Extreme Ownership must be loyal to the team and the mission above any individual. If underperformers cannot improve, <strong>the leader must make the tough call</strong> to terminate them and hire others who can get the job done. It is all on the leader.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Total responsibility for failure is a difficult thing to accept, and taking ownership when things go wrong requires extraordinary humility and courage. But doing just that is an absolute necessity to learning, growing as a leader, and improving a team’s performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a leader set ego aside, accept responsibility for failures, attack weaknesses, and consistently work to a build a better and more effective team. Such a leader, however, does not take credit for his or her team’s successes but bestows that honor upon his subordinate leaders and team members.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a leader sets such an example and expects this from junior leaders within the team, the mind-set develops into the team’s culture at every level. With Extreme Ownership, junior leaders take charge of their smaller teams and their piece of the mission. Efficiency and effectiveness increase exponentially and a high-performance, winning team is the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the direct responsibility of a leader included getting people to listen, support, and execute plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can’t make people listen to you. You can’t make them execute. That might be a temporary solution for a simple task. But to implement real change, to drive people to accomplish something truly complex or difficult or dangerous—you can’t make people do those things. You have to lead them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As the commander, everything that happened on the battlefield was my responsibility. Everything. If a supporting unit didn’t do what we needed it to do, then I hadn’t given clear instructions. If one of my machine gunners engaged targets outside his field of fire, then I had not ensured he understood where his field of fire was. If the enemy surprised us and hit us where we hadn’t expected, then I hadn’t thought through all the possibilities. No matter what, I could never blame other people when a mission went wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The essence of Extreme Ownership!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Extreme Ownership, you must remove individual ego and personal agenda. It’s all about the mission. How can you best get your team to most effectively execute the plan in order to accomplish the mission?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;ended up with a unit that never felt they were to blame for anything. All they did was make excuses and ultimately never made the adjustments necessary to fix problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very common behavior in many teams and organizations!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They see Extreme Ownership in their leaders, and, as a result, they emulate Extreme Ownership throughout the chain of command down to the most junior personnel. As a group they try to figure out how to fix their problems—instead of trying to figure out who or what to blame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using energy to find solutions, not on causes or on which people to blame.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-no-bad-teams-only-bad-leaders">Chapter 2: No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders</h2>
<p>Chapter two starts with a story about the BUD/S training, the different teams and the leader-switch. One boat kept winning, one boat kept loosing. Switching leaders helpt them both competing for the first position. The bad boat had a great leader and the second boat a great team that pushed the weak leader.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leadership is the single greatest factor in any team’s performance. Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader. The leader’s attitude sets the tone for the entire team. The leader drives performance—or doesn’t. And this applies not just to the most senior leader of an overall team, but to the junior leaders of teams within the team.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept that there were no bad teams, only bad leaders was a difficult one to accept but nevertheless a crucial concept that leaders must fully understand and implement to enable them to most effectively lead a high-performance team. Leaders must accept total responsibility, own problems that inhibit performance, and develop solutions to those problems. A team could only deliver exceptional performance if a leader ensured the team worked together toward a focused goal and enforced high standards of performance, working to continuously improve. With a culture of Extreme Ownership within the team, every member of the team could contribute to this effort and ensure the highest levels of performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When leaders who epitomize Extreme Ownership drive their teams to achieve a higher standard of performance, they must recognize that when it comes to standards, as a leader, it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate. When setting expectations, no matter what has been said or written, if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable—if there are no consequences—that poor performance becomes the new standard. Therefore, leaders must enforce standards. Consequences for failing need not be immediately severe, but leaders must ensure that tasks are repeated until the higher expected standard is achieved. Leaders must push the standards in a way that encourages and enables the team to utilize Extreme Ownership.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The leader must pull the different elements within the team together to support one another, with all focused exclusively on how to best accomplish the mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;every team must have junior leaders ready to step up and temporarily take on the roles and responsibilities of their immediate bosses to carry on the team’s mission and get the job done if and when the need arises.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The best teams &hellip; are constantly looking to improve, add capability, and push the standards higher. It starts with the individual and spreads to each of the team members until this becomes the culture, the new standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;there are no bad teams, only bad leaders facilitates Extreme Ownership and enables leaders to build high-performance teams that dominate on any battlefield, literal or figurative.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not your team succeeds or fails is all on you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An individual with a Tortured Genius mind-set can have catastrophic impact on a team&rsquo;s performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this something that technical people suffer from? Having the feeling people do not understand them?</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-believe">Chapter 3: Believe</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We had trained for hundreds of hours, iteration after iteration, drill after drill, until we could operate not just as a group of individuals, but as a team—a synchronized machine, maneuvering with precision and efficiency through the challenges of chaotic battlefields.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;kept ourselves in peak physical condition&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we train, keep up, grow, learn? And how do we train to work as a team?</p></div><div class="post-footer" id="post-footer">
